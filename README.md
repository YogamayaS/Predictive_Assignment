# Practical Machine Learning
One thing that people regularly do is to quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

The folowing process will be followed to build the prediction model:  

*       Data anlysis and data manipulation to get tidy data  
*       Data Slicing to get the training set and testing set  
*       Build the models - Random Forests and General Boosted Regression Models (GBM)  
*       Test the accuracy of the models  
*       Calculate the expected out of sample error  
*       Model Selection  
*       Cross Validation
